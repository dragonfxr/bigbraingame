1. Dashboard pages is straightforward. This makes it easy for users to move between different parts of the application.

2. Error handling: We have implemented an ErrorPopup component to display error messages instead of alert, such as when required fields are missing during registration. This helps users identify and resolve issues.

3. Dialogs for important actions: We created some dialogs to convey important information and confirm actions, such as starting and ending game sessions, copying links and showing the current session number. This ensures users are aware of the consequences of their actions and prevents accidental clicks.

4. We have used Material-UI's Box and Card components, Typography components and Container and Box components which contribute to an organized layout, making it easy for users to understand and interact with the content and can adapt to different secreen sizes and devices.
